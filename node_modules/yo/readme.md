## [Documentation](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki)


## Options

- `--no-color` flag to disable colors.
- `--version` Print the current `yo` version.
- `--help` Print `yo` help menu with the list of found generators
- `--[no-]insight` to toggle anonymous [Insight](https://github.com/yeoman/insight) tracking which helps us improve Yeoman. Using either of these flags on the first run will prevent you from being prompted about it interactively. The flags can also be used to change it later on.
- `--generators` will output the available generators


## Troubleshooting

Running `yo doctor` command can help you troubleshoot common issues.

If `doctor` doesn't help, then check opened issues for a similar problem. Open a new issue if your problem haven't been reported yet. Make sure to always include the version of `yo` (`yo --version`) and Node.js (`node --version`) you use.

If your issue only occur using a generator, please report the issues on the generator's repository.
